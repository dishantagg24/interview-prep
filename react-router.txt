react router dom provides us three arguments/properties on any component that gets rendered by route.
The three props are :-
history prop :- push(function)
location prop :- pathname(string) :- gives full path name
match prop :- isExact(boolean), params(object), path(string), url(string)

use of history->push
<button onClick={()=>props.history.push('/topics')}> Topics </button>

This is equivalent to using a link but it gives us more dynamic access. We can dynamically functionally control when we want this to work. We couldn't render a link in our componentDidMount because it's just a functional call, therefore we use history.push prop

router is low level interface we don't use it anywhere
we use BrowserRouter from react-router-dom library and routes, route from react-router library
